| Platform      | 68     | 12                       | 60      | Not Supported            |

Things may work outside of these browsers and these versions, but there might be unexpected problems as we won't be testing those environments.

If something is not working in a version listed here (or newer) please [contact support](mailto:support@stoplight.io).
